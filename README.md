# N-Body-Simulation
Simple n-body simulation implemented in Python using Pygame. 
Features:

- Bodies can be added by clicking and dragging in the screen.
- New body mass can be modified using the slider in the top right corner.
- New body initial velocity depends on how much the cursor is dragged from the initial position before releasing the key.
- The simulation has two modes: pause mode and real-time mode.
* In pause mode the future trajectory of the bodies is displayed when added new one.

  * In real time mode all bodies movement is simulated (new bodies can be also added)
